Projects done while learning from the book Essential Typescript 4 by Adam Freeman. [Book's official github repo](https://github.com/Apress/essential-typescript-4)

I learn best by doing, and getting explainations and background information along the way. In that spirit, I have typed the code for all of the projects here. However, if you want to review the official projects, check out the book's official github repo instead, linked above.

## retrospective
I enjoyed this book. The early chapters gave me a better background and language context for both Typescript and Javascript. 

I liked making the same web app with 4 different frameworks. I was most familiar with Vue.js going in, so it was interesting to see how the same features could be implemented in DOM, Angular, and React frameworks. The Vue.js section answered several questions I had when reviewing a production Vue.js application I contributed toward, but was not driving design decisions. Overall, I feel more prepared to take on full projects.
