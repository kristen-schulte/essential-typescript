# essential-typescript

Projects done while learning from the book Essential Typescript 4 by Adam Freeman. [Book's official github repo](https://github.com/Apress/essential-typescript-4)

I learn best by doing, and getting explainations and background information along the way. In that spirit, I have typed the code for all of the projects here. However, if you want to review the official projects, check out the book's official github repo instead, linked above.
